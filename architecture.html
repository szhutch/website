                    CENTRE FOR SUSTAINABLE FOOD, YORK
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The original Ministry of Food was set up during the war to teach people how to cook economically when food was rationed. Now, with potential food shortages due to Brexit (and now Coronavirus) and the shocking amount of waste that is produced by the restaurant and supermarket industries it is as important as ever to encourage people to eat sustainably by reducing waste. This scheme consists of a zero-waste restaurant, shop, community fridge/ food bank and cookery school alongside an urban farm in the centre of York. The building itself is made from recycled/ found materials to reduce its impact on the environment.

                <p >
                    The brief required the building to be a place that combined the functionality of storing life saving equipment, a large boat, and also being a place that would raise funds for the RNLI. The building consists of two main axis, one facing towards the sea housing the lifeboat equipment, and one forming a street front which houses the fundraising side, a shop, cafe, and lettable retail spaces. The large off-shore lifeboat, Shannon Class, is a key component to attracting visitors and therefore is showcased in the main lifeboat hall which has large windows facing the pier.

                    This project explores how architecture can be used to encourage social interaction and help integrate new people into a community. The social housing scheme consists of a mix of temporary apartments and more permanent family homes with a language school and cafe.
